- Step 1: Get a different geometry loaded in (maybe have a method to load dynamic geometries in in place of the current cube example)

- Step 2: Load in a dynamic amount of vertices for the construction of the geometry - the number of vertices should be equal to the number of employees at mettrr to begin the dynamic loading of geometries and algoritmic creation of network diagram shapes (could possibly look into the way D3 Network decides its shape aka: RABBITHOLE!)

- Step 3:
