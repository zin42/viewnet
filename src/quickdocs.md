=============
- 04/June/2018
> Need to get the loop to mutate the scene or actions on the scene rather than doing it direct

- 05/June/2018
> Thinking about architecture and what a well organized project will be.  
> Need to also think about getting a formal design in place to allow development to continue unhindered.  

Todo
====

*Low Level*

- Fix the mutating state bug by making actions and mutations that work with the environment

- Get the height right. We want full screen so it would be best to animate other ui into the frame

*Mid Level*

- Get the cube to load in multiple things: Consider making a module for loading things into the scene

*High Level*
- Ui
- Modules
- Data
- Architecture
- Store Actions + Mutations
